[Test Your Might JavaScirp] (https://garciae89.github.io/test-your-might/)

To meet the Acceptance Criteria for this week's challenge, we set variables to store and target the DOM with the corresponding id names. We created functions, to generate questions, start the Quiz, provide feedback based on the selected answer. We stored the HighScore in its own html page and in local storage to see OL of high scores.
